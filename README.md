# Zernike
Python code for Zernike polynomials. The `czernike.py` module is originally from [enzpy](https://github.com/jacopoantonello/enzpy) but will be further developed here instead.

# Installation

### Linux
```bash
python setup.py develop --user
```
### Windows
First install the external requirements:
* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) for Python 3
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
	- NB: Make sure you choose "Git from the command line and also 3rd-party software" in "Adjusting your PATH environment"

Then clone this repository and double-click on `install.bat`.
